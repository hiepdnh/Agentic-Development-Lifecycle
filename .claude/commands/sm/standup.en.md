## Summary

Summarize and format daily standup quickly from raw input, highlight blockers and sprint health. Triggers when: user says "summarize standup", "format daily standup", "daily scrum", "today's standup", "paste team updates", or types /sm:standup.

## Workflow

**Role**: Scrum Master / Team  
**Purpose**: Summarize and format daily standup quickly, highlight blockers.

## Execution Guide

### Step 1 — Gather input

Receive input from the team (paste raw content from Slack/chat or a list from each person):

```
## Paste your team's standup updates here.

Input format doesn't matter — raw text, bullet points, or prose are all fine.
I will format it properly.

I need to know: When does Sprint [N] end?
```

### Step 2 — Summarize and format

```markdown
# Daily Standup — [Date]
**Sprint [N]** | **Day [X]/[Y]**

---

## Team Updates

### [Member 1 name]

- 🔄 **Today**: [...]
- ⛔ **Blockers**: [None / Description]

## ⚠️ Sprint Health
