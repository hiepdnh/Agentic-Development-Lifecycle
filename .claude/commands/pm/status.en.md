# Skill: /pm:status
**Role**: Project Manager  
**Purpose**: Aggregate sprint/project status from multiple sources, generate a quick report for stakeholders.

## Execution Guide

### Step 1 — Collect information

Ask the user to provide (or read from available context):
- List of issues/tasks in the sprint and their status
- Known blockers
- Remaining time in the sprint

### Step 2 — Gate: Confirm report scope

```
## I will create a status report for Sprint [N].

Before compiling, let me know:

| # | Question | Choice |
|---|---------|--------|
| 1 | Who is this report for? | A: Team internal / B: Stakeholder / C: Management / D: Japanese client / E: Other: ___ |
| 2 | Preferred format? | A: HTML dashboard (recommended for stakeholders/JP clients) / B: Markdown (post to Slack/Notion) / C: Plain text / D: Other: ___ |
| 3 | Any specific metrics to highlight? | A: Velocity / B: Burn rate / C: Blockers / D: Not needed / E: Other: ___ |
```

### Step 3 — Generate Status Report

**Format determined by Gate 2 question 2**:
- **A — HTML dashboard** (default for stakeholders/JP clients): generate `docs/reports/sprint-[N]-status.html` from template `templates/html-artifact.html` — see structure below
- **B — Markdown**: generate inline in chat or save `docs/reports/sprint-[N]-status.md` — use Markdown template below
- **C — Text**: one-screen summary in chat

#### HTML format (option A)

Inject into template:
- Header: Sprint [N] · Velocity badge (X/Y points) · Burn rate pill (ok/warn/err)
- Section "Kanban view": 4 columns Done / In Progress / Blocked / To Do using CSS grid, each card is a task
- `<table data-sortable>` for Risks & Actions with Impact column using pill
- Filter `<input type="search" data-filter="...">` for task list
- `@media print` ensures clean A4 printing when forwarding by email to JP clients

HTML file is NOT committed (if inside `docs/tasks/`). Saving to `docs/reports/` means it can be committed — decide based on project storage needs.

#### Markdown format (option B/fallback)

```markdown
