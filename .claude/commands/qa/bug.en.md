## Summary

Create a standardized bug report with severity, steps to reproduce, and sufficient evidence for devs to fix. Triggers when: user says "found a bug", "write bug report", "report an issue", "create bug ticket", "there's a defect", or types /qa:bug.

## Workflow

# Skill: /qa:bug
**Role**: QA Engineer  
**Purpose**: Create a standardized bug report with enough information for devs to reproduce and fix.

---

## Execution Guide

### Step 1 — Gate: Gather information

```
## I will help you write a bug report.

Tell me:

| # | Question | Options |
|---|---------|---------|
| 1 | Brief description of the issue | _(type here)_ |
| 2 | Environment where found | A: Dev / B: Staging / C: Production / D: Other: ___ |
| 3 | Browser / OS / device | _(type here)_ |
| 4 | Steps to reproduce | _(type here — rough is fine)_ |
| 5 | Expected vs Actual behavior | _(type here)_ |
| 6 | Do you have screenshots/logs? | A: Yes (attached) / B: No / C: Other: ___ |
| 7 | Frequency of the bug | A: 100% on every reproduction / B: Intermittent (~___%) / C: Other: ___ |
```

### Step 2 — Classify severity

Evaluate based on impact:

- **Critical**: Crash, data loss, security breach, payment failure
- **High**: Core feature broken, no workaround
- **Medium**: Feature degraded, workaround exists
- **Low**: UI issue, minor inconvenience

Ask if unclear: *"Is there a workaround for this issue? Can the user continue working?"*

### Step 3 — Create Bug Report

Create the bug report using template `templates/bug-report.en.md`.

### Step 4 — Final gate

```
Bug report has been written.

Before submitting:

| # | Question | Options |
|---|---------|---------|
| 1 | Steps to reproduce — confirmed reproducible? | A: Yes / B: No — fix steps: ___ / C: Other: ___ |
| 2 | Is severity [X] correct? | A: Correct / B: Higher — raise to: ___ / C: Lower — lower to: ___ / D: Other: ___ |
| 3 | Should anyone else be tagged? | A: No / B: Yes — username: ___ / C: Other: ___ |
```
