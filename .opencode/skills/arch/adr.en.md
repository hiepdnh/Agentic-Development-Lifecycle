## Execution Guide

### Step 1 — Gate: Gather context

question({
  questions: [{
    question: "What is the problem/context leading to this decision?",
    header: "Context",
    options: [
      { label: "I will describe", description: "I will provide detailed context" },
    ]
  }, {
    question: "What options have been considered?",
    header: "Options",
    options: [
      { label: "I will list them", description: "I will provide the options considered" },
    ]
  }]
})

### Step 2 — Create ADR

Create file `docs/decisions/ADR-[NNN]-[slug].md` using template `E:\AI Bootcamp\ClaudeSkill\templates\adr.md`.

Fill in all sections:
- **Context**: situation + constraints leading to the decision
- **Decision**: definitive, not ambiguous
- **Options Considered**: at least 2, including the chosen option
- **Consequences**: positive + negative/trade-offs
- **Conditions to Revisit**: specific triggers (not "when needed")

### Step 3 — Final Gate

question({
  questions: [{
    question: "ADR is ready. Are the 'negative consequences' honest enough?",
    header: "Review",
    options: [
      { label: "Sufficient", description: "Trade-offs have been fully documented" },
      { label: "Need more", description: "Some negative consequences are not mentioned" },
    ]
  }, {
    question: "Does any team member need to review before accepting?",
    header: "Reviewers",
    options: [
      { label: "Not needed", description: "Can be accepted immediately" },
      { label: "Needs review", description: "Someone else needs to review first" },
    ]
  }]
})

After confirmation, I will update the status to "Accepted".
