## Summary

Refine vague ideas into clear concepts with a problem statement and NOT Doing list. Use before /ba:spec to avoid mis-specs from the start. Trigger when: user says "có ý tưởng muốn explore", "chưa biết làm gì", "brainstorm feature", "idea còn mơ hồ", "muốn clarify hướng đi", "have an idea to explore", "fuzzy concept", "want to brainstorm", or type /pm:ideate.

## Workflow

# Skill: /pm:ideate
**Role**: PM / BA  
**Purpose**: Refine vague ideas into clear concepts BEFORE running /ba:spec. Avoid mis-specs from the start.

## When to Use

- Stakeholder request is very vague ("do something with the dashboard")
- Multiple directions possible, unclear which way to go
- Want to explore options before committing to a spec

## Execution Guide

### Step 1 — Gate: Collect raw idea

```
## I will help clarify this idea.

Tell me: what problem are you trying to solve?
(Doesn't need to be complete — a rough idea is fine)
```

### Step 2 — Diverge: Create 5-8 variations

Analyze the idea through these lenses:

- **Inversion**: What if we did the opposite?
- **Simplification**: What's the simplest possible version?
- **Constraint removal**: What if there were no time/budget limits?
- **Analogy**: How do other industries solve similar problems?
- **User focus**: If we only needed to solve for 1 specific user, what would we do?

Create 5-8 concise variations (2-3 sentences each).

### Step 3 — Converge: Group into 2-3 directions

Cluster the variations into 2-3 strategic directions:

```
## I see [N] approaches:

### Direction A: [Name — distinctive keyword]
[2-3 sentence description]
- Best when: [condition]
- Risk: [main risk]

### Direction B: [Name]
...

### Direction C: [Name] (if any)
...
```

### Step 4 — One-pager + "Not Doing" list

```
## Proposed direction: [Direction X]

**Problem statement**: [1 sentence]
**Proposed solution**: [2-3 sentences]
**Target users**: [Who]
**Success metric**: [How to measure success]

### ❌ NOT Doing (important)
- [Thing 1 not in this scope]
- [Thing 2 not done]
- [Thing 3 not done]

| # | Question | Choice |
|---|---------|--------|
| 1 | Is the "Not Doing" list correct? | A: Correct / B: Something still in scope — item: ___ / C: Other: ___ |
| 2 | Is the success metric measurable? | A: Yes / B: Not enough — change to: ___ / C: Other: ___ |
| 3 | Ready to run /ba:spec with this direction? | A: Ready / B: Need more exploration — direction: ___ / C: Other: ___ |
```

## Note

- The "Not Doing list" is as important as the "Doing list" — it helps avoid scope creep
- If the team disagrees on the direction → this is a signal to facilitate more, not to skip this step
