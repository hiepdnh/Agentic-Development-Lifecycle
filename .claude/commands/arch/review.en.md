## Execution Guide

### Step 1 — Receive input

Input can be:
- Description of the design decision to review
- Code snippet / diagram
- PR link
- Spec document

### Step 2 — Gate: Confirm review scope

```
## I will review [design/component name].

Before I start, tell me:

| # | Question | Options |
|---|---------|---------|
| 1 | What should the review focus on? | A: Scalability / B: Security / C: Maintainability / D: Performance / E: All / F: Other: ___ |
| 2 | Are there any constraints I should know? | _(type here — team size, deadline, tech debt...)_ |
| 3 | Are there any related ADRs? | A: Yes — link: ___ / B: No / C: Other: ___ |
```

### Step 3 — Analyze and Review

Evaluate across these lenses:

**1. Correctness** — Is the logic correct?
**2. Scalability** — Can it handle increased load?
**3. Maintainability** — Can future team members understand and modify it?
**4. Security** — Are there any attack surfaces?
**5. Performance** — Where are the bottlenecks?
**6. Coupling** — Is it too dependent on other modules?
**7. Testability** — Is it easy to test?

### Step 4 — Present results

```
